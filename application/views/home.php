                My name is Jack Lucas Gilmore McBride and i'm currently studying for my MSc in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Kent.
                As a Computer Science student, I have a mind for problem solving, analytical thinking, and generally engaging with abstraction.
            </p>
            <p class = "intro_body">
                During my Undergraduate and Masters courses, I have developed a strong understanding across a range of Computer Science principles. The focus
                of my MSc course is Computer Security; through which I have developed some fundamental knowledge of areas
                such as system security, vulnerabilities within the Internet of Things, and cryptography.
